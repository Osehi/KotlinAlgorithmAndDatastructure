/**
 * Discoveries
 * 1. For the first time I understood that "Class" is used to represent a real life object.
 * Philp use a "Class" to represent a Rectangle.
 * => The "Class" had everything about a "Rectangle"
 * => It captured the properties of a Rectangle such as its "length" and "breadth".
 * => It had methods; such as area, isItASquare, etc.
